# Chapter 8 Sections 1 & 2 Examples

## 8.1 Basic Notation and Terminology

### Example 8.1

*The Maclaurin series for a function is the finite way to display a larger one.*

$$\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + ... = \sum_{n=0}^{\inf} x^n$$

If we multiply by $1 - x$ we get 1

so when

$$(1 - x)(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + ...) = 1$$

we can also say that

$$\frac{1}{x-1} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + ...$$

therefore

$$\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + ... = \sum_{n=0}^{\inf} x^n$$

### Example 8.2

We can also do it for a finite series. Some of the calculations take lots of work but they help to prove the formal power series.

## 8.2 Another look at distributing apples or folders

### Example 8.4

When we look at the propblem again of apples or folders we can see that there is  another way to express it

$$C(n-1, m) = the coeffecient of \frac{x}{1-5}^m$$

### Example 8.5

$$\frac{x}{(1-x)^3} which's coefficient is 210$$

### Example 8.6

$$\frac{(-1)^n}{4} - \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3(n+1}{2}$$
