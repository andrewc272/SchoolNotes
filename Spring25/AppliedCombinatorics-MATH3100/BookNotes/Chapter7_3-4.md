## Section 7.3

### Example 7.13

> Consider the Hat Check problem, but suppose istead of wanting no man to leave with his own hat, we are interested in the number of ways to distribute the $100$ hats so that precisely $40$ of the men leave with their own hats.

> If $40$ men leave with their own hats, then there are $60$ men who donot receive their own hats. THre are $C(100,60) ways to choose the $60$ men who will not receive their own hats and $d_{60}$ ways to distribute those hats so that no mn receives his own. There's only one way to distribute the $40$ hats to the men who  their own hats, meaning that there are

$$\binom{100}{60} d_60 = 420788734922281721283274628333913452107678525002320680486289651537677289131789$$

such ways to return the hats.

> SageMath reports that

$$1369122257328767073 = 3^3 11 19^4 31^2 6067^2$$

/ is the factoization of $1369122257328767073$ into primes. It follows that
