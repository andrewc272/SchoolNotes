## 2.1 Strings: a first look

- Strings can be called sequences or arrays and are defined by elements inside of the set X, as defined by an alphabet

### Example 2.1

>In the state of Georgia, license plates consist of four digits followed by a space followed by three capital letters. Tht efirst digit cannot be a 0. How many license plates are possible?

**Given:** $$s = x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7$$

<p style="text-align: center;">Where</p>

- $$x_1 = Digit (1-9)$$     
- $$x_2, x_3, x_4 = Digit (0-9)$$     
- $$x_5, x_6, x_7 = Capitol Letter (A-Z)$$
