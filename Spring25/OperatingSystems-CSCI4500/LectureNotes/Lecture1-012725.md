## Class Introduction

- Well be done by like 8 probably
- 4 progrmming assignments
- Due dates are pretty solid but 

### Background

- Product of UNO
    - 3 degrees
    - Taught many classes as well
- Software Engineer, Project Manager, Researcher
    - Small consulting firms
    - Worked with many microprocessors
    - real world experiances
- Realtime operating systems

<br> 

- Always ask for help!!

## Review

### Processors & Memory

- Processor or the brain
    - Different ISA's
    - registers
    - Fetch -> Decode -> execute
    - Mulit-core
    - OS virtualizes the CPU
- Memory
    - Highter speed = more $$$
    - CPU Registers
    - Cache
    - Different types of memory to manage
    - OS Virtualizes memory as well
    - SSM
    - Flash
    - Older Core memory
    - RAM vs ROM
    = Non-Volatile vs Volatile

> There is no free lunch there are benefits and drawbacks to each of the pieces of technology

- Disks
    - More memory
- Memory management Unit
    - Manages Virtual Memory
    - Memory protection
    - Cache, Translation Lookaside Buffer

- BUS
- Microcontrollers
    - procesor with various I/O peripherals
    - Ideal for embedded systems

## Operating System History

- ENIAC
    - Made with 18,00 vacuum tubes
    - No operating system
- Generation 1
    - Vacuum tubes and plugboards
- Generation 2
    - Transistors and batch systems
    - Started to use some sorts of OS
        - GM-NAA I/O
        - UMES OS
- Generation 3
    - ICs and Multiprogramming
    - OS/360
    - UNIX
- Generation 4
    - Personal Computers
    - MS DOS, Apple DOS, UNIX, Linux, Windows, MacOS
- Mobile OS
    - Android, IOS
- Minix 3
    - Operating system we will look at in class
- Most Powerful Computer
    - 11,039,616 combined CPUs and GPUs
    - 1.743 exaFlops on the LINPACK benchmark
    - Based on Red Hat Linux

## Goals of an Operating System

- Vrtualize everything to make it easier ot use as an application developer

- How to evaluate an operating system
    - Reliability and Availability
    - Secure
    - Portability
    - Performance
