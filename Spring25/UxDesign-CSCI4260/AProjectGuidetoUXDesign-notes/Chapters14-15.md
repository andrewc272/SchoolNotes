# Chapters 14 and 15 Notes

## Chapter 14 Design Testing

Concept
: generally the word used to describe an abstract idea, such as happiness, collaboration, or efficiency, In the field of UX design, Concept is also used to refer to design elements that aremeant to represent one or more abstract ideas to the product team or a potential user.

### Choosing a Design Testing Approach

- this will effect what kind of skills you need

#### In-Person Research vs. Remote Research

- context of environment
    - By conducting reaser remotely-rather than going to the user's location-you will lose some fo the overall context of their environment
- Context of need
    - There's a benefit to using remote research regarding context here
- access
    - Hewe's an area where remote research often proves the best approach
- Cost
    - Remote research is often thought of as being less expensive than in-person research.

#### Remote Research Considerations

- choose tools carefully
    - Recruiting and Panel management
    - Scheduling
    - Incentive distribution
    - Brainstorming and Collaboration
    - Usability Testing (Moderated)
    - A/B Testing (Live Site)
    - Insight Management
    - End-to-End Platforms
- Consider what hardware and software your users are likely to have
- Test your setup before sessions begin
- Have IT troubleshooting expertise at the ready if possible

#### Moderated Techniques vs. Unmoderated Techniques

- There are techniques that have a moderator and ones that don't
- Wgat objective are you trying to achieve?
- What forms of data do you want to capture?
- How would you like to recruit users?
- How will participants get to your test?
- Who's doing the analysis?

- un moderation can be for more simple tasks and easy questions

### Exploring Visual Design Mock-Ups

- making more mock-ups means that people are more likely to be able to critisize different pieces

Common info:
- Common brand associations made by your participants
- Design and lifestyle fit
- Effectivness of a particular mock-up in explaining a new concept
- Ways that participants define some of the key terms you're using
- Participant concerns

### Usability Testing

- Planning the research
- Recruiting and logistics
- Writing discussion guides
- Facilitating
- Analyzing and presenting results
- Creating recommendations

- Quantitative reasearch allows for settign of measurable benchmarks that can be tested against in later iterations
- Qualitative research builds experience and empathy in the designer, promoting creative solutions focused on the user.

#### Planning the Research

- user research plane

#### Why Are You Testing?

#### Who Are You Testing?

#### What Are You Testing?

- Areas where the design breaks some established conventions
- Areas where team members disagree about how to solve an important design problem
- Areas where usability issues can have critical consequences

#### What information Are you Gathering?

- create prompts and figure out how well users are able to get to and find the target

#### Recruiting and Logistics

- get people

#### Generating a List

- registered users
- sites or groups relevant ot your topic of reasearch
- messages to acquantences with a connection to the subject of the test
- Requests in the form of short surveys that prequealify participants
- postings or prequalifications questionnaires in public places where potential participatns  may be found
- Third- party recruiting firms

#### Choosing the Compensation

- how general or specific is the audience?
- How much interest is the topic likely to generate?
- Will people participate mainly becase they want to contribute something to the cause?
- How inconvenient will participation be?

#### Screening

Screenter
: a type of questionaire you can user withpotential participats before you schedule them

Questions
- Ensure the respondent is either a current user of the features you're testing or a likely future user
- Determine their fit into one or more of your user groups
- help you get a goood mix of participants within that user group
- Exclude particular respondents who may have eperience that could skew your results
- Gather key details you need to know about before a participant arrives

#### Planning for Space and Equipment

- where are you testing
- what staff will you need besides the facilitator?
- How will you be recordign the test?

#### Writing Discussion Guides

- this is the way you should collect what you will need

#### INTRODUCTION

- Start 

### Task 1

- make a task for the user to complete

- Consetn from for recording
- Discussion guide for the facilitator
- discussion guide for the participant
- A format for note-taking
- optionally, a questionnare
- the method of compensation

### Facilitating

- The job of the facilitator is to introduce the participant ot he process, answer their initial questions, and then glean what insights you can while still trying to allow the participant ot act as naturally as possible

#### Analyzing and Presenting Results

- Set a time for analysis
- determine how the results will be used

#### Prioritizing Issues

- Consequences
- Recoverability
- Frequency of occurrence
- Rational cause

#### Generating Insights

- Goals
- mental models
- ideas and feature requests
- frustrations and pain points
- workarounds
- value statements
- Delights
- Expectations

#### Creating Recommendations

- Experiments "We did this..."
- Facts "... and we found out this..."
- Insights "...which makes us think this..."
- Recommendations "... so we'll do that."

- Resolve more than one issue, ifpossible
- Be actionable and simple
- Use verbiage that is straightforward but doesn't condescend

## Chpater 15 Launch And Release

### Almost done?

- The US design process is far from over

### Launch vs. Release

- is to create so that it stays out or just putting it out there to continue to improve.

#### Full Releases: The Path to Growth

Full releases or launces
: this is a significant growth-focused shift

#### Dot Releases: The Cycle of Iteration

- these focus on smaller changes that don't shift the direction of a whole project

#### Common Threads: Analytics and Observation

- continue doing research and find ways to put more out there

### Now What?

Rinse Repeat

## Essential Questions

- What factors shoudl you consider when deciding whether to perform design testing in person or remotely?

It matters on the budget the ability of the people around you and how intensive the testing must be

- What are the differences between moderated and unmoderated techinques?

This is where you either have someone watching or not. Unmoderated can mean to have a computer analyze things.

- What are the steps of usability testing?

Planning the research, recruiting and logistics, writing discussion guides, facilitating, analyzing and presenting results, and creating recommendations.

- What is the difference between a launch and a release?

launch is bigger and is a more significan change to a product. a release is more like maintenence and bug fixes.

## Reflection Questions

- Describe rough usability test plan you could use to test the digital versionn of this textbook?

We can see how other people read the book and what they got out of it inthe class and then compare it to what the authors intetions for the book were. That way the authors can change the book to be clearer to their meaning.

- Overall, what did you think about the book?

I liked it it wasn't a hard read and had pleanty of good information and advise.

- What is something you learned from the book that you think will be useful in your career?

I think learning how to correctly audit ideas for what will work best will be helpful. I usually develope without thinking of the outcomes before hand. I think the user first mindset will help to set up my career for success.

- What is something you learned from the book that you think will be useful in your non-work life?

I think learning that it is ok to make a plan first is useful. Getting feedback from other people on ideas will make your ideas better and help you to better empathise with people around you.

- What is a change you would make to the book?

I think I would have prefered just a little bit more content about specifically how to make it all look pretty. I know it talks about asking other people if it looks pretty but it itself doesn't explain in great detail what design choices will make the fisst products look better.
