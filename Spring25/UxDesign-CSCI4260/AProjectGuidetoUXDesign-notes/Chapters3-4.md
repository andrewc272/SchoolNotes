# Chapter 3-4 of A Project Guide to UX Design

## Chapter 3 DesignOps, ResearchOps, ContentOps, Oh My!

### Design Operations

- Design Operations role is to make the collaboration accross projects and teams smooth and seemless
- they make a systematic aproach to complete a project given a team of people and certain deadlines
- They allow people to do the job that they want to do and encourage avoidning the taxing roles of communications and other kinds of strategy role

#### The Role of DesignOps on a Design Team

- Standardizing processes
- Management of tools and licensing
- Leading loaboration and critique
- Managing quality and standards
- Management and maintenance of design system
- resourcing and staffing
- Leading research operations

> Different companies will have different policies according to their size on what this team is composed of

### Research Operations

- The research Operations team does both research and helps to inform the whole operation

#### The rold of ResearchOps on a Design Team

- Developing and standardizing processes
- Managing tools and infrastructure
- Managing and governing knowledge and data
- Planning and coordinating research
- Recruiting and managing participats
- training and continuing education
- Budgenting and resource planning

> The researchOps team helps streamline the whole process by finding and discovering tools and helping to collect information and being the best informed ad they can be on the specific topic

### Content Operations

- Content operations moderates the outputed content from the company ensuring its consistancy and the image it creates for the company at large

#### The role of ContentOps on a Design Team

- Strategizing and plinning content
- Producing content and facilitating editorial processes
- Managing content assets

- Measuring content performance

> The cpntent OPs team helps make continuous improvement to the typse of content and all the practices across the organizaition and help to bring colaboration to a company at large

### Bonus Operations

- DevOps makes something new
- DevSecOps ensures the security of everything

### ConclusionOps

- All in all all the roles work to improve the efficientcy of output increasing both the speed of developement  and the quality. It helps every role to be more specific and to give it the ability to 

## Chapter 4 Project Opjectives and Approach

- Why is the project importand to the company?
- How will stakeholders determine if the project was a success?
- What approach or *methodology* will the project follow?
- What are the major dates or *milestones* for key points, such as gettign approval from business stakeholders?

Project Objective:
: a statement of a measurable goal for the project

### Solidify Project Objectives

A clear objective helps you to 
- ask the right questions
- find good ways to reasearch for the project
- gather ideas and consolidate them
- prioritize the project ideas based on company value
- define specific features 
- create effective design concepts
- manage changes in dirrection after you start the project
- focus efforts during deployment activities
- Determine whether youve met the needs of the client company after the end of the project

A solid objective is:
- Easy to understand
- distinct
- Measurable

### Understand the Project Approach

Most project methodologies involve these steps:
- Plan
- Discover
- Define
- Design
- Develop
- Deploy
- iterate

#### Waterfall Methodology

- the waterfall method clearly defines the project then designs develops and deploys it
    - prone to be bad if the project needs to change for any reason

#### Agile Methodologies

- agile is similar to waterfall but it splits it up into smaller iterations making it more adaptable to changes during the project
- Scrum
    - Involves short sprints where different teams work on different projects and there are daily checkins to prevent blockers
- Kanban
    - Visual signal for the workload and progress
- SAFe
    - Is a combination of scrum and kanban that is best used by large companies

#### Other approaches a Designer should know

- Double Diamond
    - split up to understand the problem independantly then come together to define
    - split up to ideate prototype then come together again to test and create the solution
- Lean UX
    - This involves cutting as much out to get the concept out there to simply test ideas and not intended to create a product
- Dual-track product development
    - this is where there is two things always being done during development learning and building
- Design sprints
    - Tbis is a method on solving sprints in a quick and simple manner

- create a minimally viable product to start

### How does the Approach Affect Me?

- What quesitons you should be asking and when
- Expectations on how project team members will collaborate and how close that collaboration will be
- the level of detail needed in your documentation and the level of formality
- Important milestones that involve approval from stake holders and deployment to different groups

## Essential Questions:

1. What is the role of DesignOps on a design team?

- Design Operations role is to make the collaboration accross projects and teams smooth and seemless

2. Why is designOps important?

- it helps with bigger groups of people to have better communication and product design

3. How are research operations critical to good design?

- This helps the team find the best tools for the job as well as help them conduct and collect research. They can see how successfull a particular design is compared to others.

4. What are the four questions you should have answered by the end of a kickoff meeting?

- Why is the project important to the company?
- How will stakeholders determine if the project was a success?
- What approach or *methodology* will the project follow?
- What are the major dates or *milestones* for key points, such as getting approval from  business stakeholders?

5. What is...
    A. the waterfall method?

    - this method is where you research everything then design everything, then develope everything, then deploy everything.

    B. the agile method?

    - agile is similar to waterfall but everything is broken up into iterations making it easier to switch the direction of the project if need be.

    C. the double diamond?

    - The double diamond is where everyone goes out and does their own research then they come together to compile the research and find a target. Then they spread to find a solution and comback together to test and make sure the solution works altogether.

    D. lean UX?

- This is where a simple product is made in a not final form so that the tool itself can be tested for necesity and useability.

    E. dual-track product development?

- this is where teams simutaniously learn about and build the final product.

    F. a design sprint?

- this is a sprint designed to have a prototype made and tested in just one week.

## Reflection Questions:

1. These chapters are really focused on organization and planning, why are these critical to doing design in industry?

In the world there are deadlines so having a plan ensures that these will be met. Also ensuring that everyone has a clear idea of what the object makes communication between different teams that are working on different components cohesive.

2. Which of the project planning and management mothods appealed to you the most and why?

The waterfall made a lot of sense and is typically kind of the thing I follow when working on projects. I do see that in industry agile or other methods are significantly hindered by this kind of "put on your horse blinders and go" kind of method.

3.  Between design ops, content ops, and research ops, which appeled to you most and why?

- research ops appealed to me most because I like the idea of being able to find and reasearch or even developing new tools that help a project get done faster and more efficiently.
