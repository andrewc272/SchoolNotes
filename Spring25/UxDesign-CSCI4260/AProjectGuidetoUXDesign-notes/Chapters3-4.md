## Chapter 4 Project Opjectives and Approach

- Why is the project importand to the company?
- How will stakeholders determine if the project was a success?
- What approach or *methodology* will the project follow?
- What are the major dates or *milestones* for key points, such as gettign approval from business stakeholders?

Project Objective:
: a statement of a measurable goal for the project

### Solidify Project Objectives

A clear objective helps you to 
- ask the right questions
- find good ways to reasearch for the project
- gather ideas and consolidate them
- prioritize the project ideas based on company value
- define specific features 
- create effective design concepts
- manage changes in dirrection after you start the project
- focus efforts during deployment activities
- Determine whether youve met the needs of the client company after the end of the project

A solid objective is:
- Easy to understand
- distinct
- Measurable

### Understand the Project Approach

Most project methodologies involve these steps:
- Plan
- Discover
- Define
- Design
- Develop
- Deploy
- iterate

#### Waterfall Methodology

- the waterfall method clearly defines the project then designs develops and deploys it
    - prone to be bad if the project needs to change for any reason

#### Agile Methodologies

- agile is similar to waterfall but it splits it up into smaller iterations making it more adaptable to changes during the project
- Scrum
    - Involves short sprints where different teams work on different projects and there are daily checkins to prevent blockers
- Kanban
    - Visual signal for the workload and progress
- SAFe
    - Is a combination of scrum and kanban that is best used by large companies

#### Other approaches a Designer should know

- Double Diamond
    - split up to understand the problem independantly then come together to define
    - split up to ideate prototype then come together again to test and create the solution
- Lean UX
    - This involves cutting as much out to get the concept out there to simply test ideas and not intended to create a product
- Dual-track product development
    - this is where there is two things always being done during development learning and building
- Design sprints
    - Tbis is a method on solving sprints in a quick and simple manner

- create a minimally viable product to start

### How does the Approach Affect Me?

- What quesitons you should be asking and when
- Expectations on how project team members will collaborate and how close that collaboration will be
- the level of detail needed in your documentation and the level of formality
- Important milestones that involve approval from stake holders and deployment to different groups
