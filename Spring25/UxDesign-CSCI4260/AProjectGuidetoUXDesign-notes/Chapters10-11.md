# Chapters 10 and 11 notes

## Chapter 10 Product Definition

- you should have the following so far
    - Stakeholder requirements
    - Competitive analysis
    - User requests
    - User research insigts
    - Persona and profile discussions
    - User flows
    - Journey maps
    - And your own creative mind

- nwo we need to
    - Give structure to your ideas
    - Estimate effort and determine priorities
    - Define chosen ideas and prepare them for product design

### structurign Ideas

- Understand and compare eachother's idea's potential vlue for users and the business
- Estimate the idea's design and development effort
- Prioritize which to work on, in which order
- Describe concrete needs, possibilties, and constraints to inform the design effort.
- Determine functional specifications that will ready the ideas for development and Quality Assurance efforts

three levels of ideas that you could use for the discussion

1. High level: Passengers can chage or upgrade their assigned seat before purchasing the ticket
2. Mid level: Passengers can choose their seat using a map of seats for that plane
3. Low level: Passengers can select an available seat from the seat map and see an updated cost

### User stories, Features and Epics

User story
: is a unit of work for the product team, written from the point of view of a user, and ideally of a size that can be completed byt he team within one development sprint

- the structure of a user story is meant to connect tohe *user role* with the *action* they're taking and the *goal* that prompted their action

As a **[User role]**
I want to **[action]**
so I can **[goal]**

As a **Passenger**,
I want to **change my seat assignment**
So I can **Sit closer to the front of the plane**.

Related actions

- Review a map of ceast to see which one is currently ine, which are uavailable and which are available with reatated costs.
- Select an available seat
- Review the updated total
- Confirm or cancel my change

Acceptance criteria
: details on what needs to be present in the product in order for the story to be considered complete by the product manager and Quality Assurance team.

Feature
: a distinct piece of functionaluty witha benefit to the user and business

function
La unit of development work that enables the product more behind the scenes

Epics
: a collection of related user stories or features, typically at a level that implies a longer-term scope of work or ongoing need for iterative improvement.

There are a few wayss terms are used to group and give structure to ideas including
- themes relate stories that may belong ot different epics
- Initiatives have more of a project orientation, something with an expected outcome and time period associated with it.
- user activities are user-centric ways to structure the product's hierarchy from top to bottom using the user's journey
- Jobs to be don(JTBD) form a customer0centric framework that focuses on the jobs that people need done rather than hyst products and their features.


### Prioritization

- Prioritizing outcomes, such as "increase the percentage of users who complete the booking process once they've initiated it"
- prioritizing features, such as our "change seating" example
- prioritizing user stories, such as our "select an available seat" example

#### Prioritization techniques

techniques vary based on
- how collaborative you can makeyour prioritization process
- What level of idea you'd like to prioritize (high, mid, low)
- How much you already know about th eindustry productfeature set, or technology you'll be using

- what is its value to the business and its customers
- what complexity is involved in implementing the idea?

- we can list ideas and then rank them on their complexity and the value they add

#### Roles in Prioritization

- Business advocate: represents the business needs and requirements and ensures they are captured and met as faithfully as possible.
- User advocate: represents the needs and perspectives of the primary users who will experience the site
- Development advocate: represents the needs and constraints of development and quality assurance teams
- Outcome advocate: represents the purpose of the initiative and drives the deam toward desired outcomes

conflicts
- the team is not on the same page about the project objectivesor underlying business strategies 
- opposing team members are closely tied to a certain set of features
- there are conflicts between business needs and user needs that are not easily resolved
- the technologies being used are relatively new to the development team, so they're uncomfortable making estimates

### Feature Definition

Questions

- What is the product vision?
- What problem are we solving and why?
- What technology considerations should we keep in mind?
- What user insights should we keep in mind?
- What project considerations should we keep in mind?
- Are there any design or guiding principles for this effort?
- What job stories should we include?
- How are we going to measre success?
- How we will determine whether the problem has been solved? What is our desired outcome?
- What do we consider in scope or out of scope for this feature?
- Are there any thought starters the team would like to share?

capute these questions
 
- in your brain

Get some inspiration but don't get carried away we must get a solid foundation before we can start.

## Chapter 11 Design Foundations

### Universal Principles

- Visual design principles regaarding the relationship between elements in a view
- Interaction principles regarding the way users move through the sit's spaces
- psychology principles affecting the way users may perceive and engage with your design

#### Visual Design

this affects a user's understanding of your brand and often affects the trust placed in the product

#### Unity and Variety

Uninity
: is the degree to which elements in your design have an obvious association with each other.

variaety
: differences between elements clear and add to a sense of frexhness or exploration

#### Hierarchy and Dominance

Hierarchy
: the established order of the elements being viewed

dominance
: Generally, objects that are larger, brighter, and have highter contrast against other objects on the page have more dominance


#### Simplicity

simplicity
: when elements on the page are purposeful, relevant, and informationrich, and when those that aren't are removed - you are able to ensure the information can be eaily digested and acted upon.

- minimalism is good but when it goes too far it can hinder a user's ability to get things done

#### Interaction

interaction
: dstarts with a desire to act and the understanding that something can be acted on

#### Associations and affordance

keep these in mind when designing objects that need to be acted on

- consider the value of an association with something of common use in the physical world that provides clues on how it is used digitally. Will it be helpful and work well in the digital space?
- Consider the likely *Perceived affordance* of the design element
0 Regardless of whether you use an association with something in the physical world try to follow common standards of interactive elements online
- If you have an international audience, spend some time researching how associations may vary across your user base and adjust your icons or imagery if needed.

#### Movements and Gestures

economy of motion
- how far is it from the where the user probably is
- are you requireing uss to switch methods of input0 forexample, from keyboard to mouse or from touchscreen to voice?
- How easy is it to act on the object?

#### Response

frustration can rise from 

- poor performance such as search results taking a long time to return:
- poor error handling
- lack of feedback on results

#### Psychology

- the emotional effect of an attractive design
- the personal, or intrinsic, motivation people have to take on new challenges within your product
- Social proof - or the effect that second, third, and 164tg opinions and hehavior can have on a user's decisions regarding your product

#### The effect of Attractive design

- people generally perceive that an attracive product is easier to use
- an attractive design builds trust
- Pleasurable products create positive feelings and, as a result, increased creativity.

#### Flow and Gamification

flow
: is the state of deep immersion that people feel when engaged in an actiity that provides a challenge appropriate to their perceived level of skill.

- presentation of an activity that has a clear set of goals
- a particular balance between the challenges presented and the skillset that the participants perceive they have
- clear feedback reagarding th eparticipant's performance as they perform the activity

more engaging products have the following qualities

- well-structured, clearly explained, and consistent rules of interaction
- a series of well-defiened and sequenced goals
- Immersive gamepley, engaging multiple senses
- feedback on performance, with the ability to try challenges multiple times to increase skill
- social interaction, either with fellow game-players or via a community that shares tips and results

Gamification
: the process of using game design concepts to engage users in ways that aren't traditionally considered game environments

adding social and competetive elements to a product can really improve the quality and engagement with said product.

#### Social Proof

- we are social creatures

social proof
: of popular support of a particular choice or action

- things like comment sections can be very popular and you decide what applications you want to install based on reviews

#### Choice Architecture

- this is how something is designed so that the user makes a certain decision

darkpatterns
: the choice in a way that encourages people to choose something that has an expense or detriment to themselves but benefits the company.

### Product Foundatios

you should make sure you ground your project and set your guidlines so that you have prinicples that people can get behind

#### Product-specific Design Principles

- base your design principles on researc conducted with your target users
- make the main statemnet snappy and memorable
- add a principle only if it helps focus the team and differentiate the product
- refine your principles collaboratively across the project team.

#### Design Systems and Standards

design system
: is a set of standards, guidlines, and toolkits that typically include

- principles based on user research or best practices such as the ones we covered above
- standards that should be followed such as privacy policiesm security practices,and accessibility compliance
- a style guide that illustrates the types of colors, fonts, imagery,logos, and other visual elements that should be used within the product, with guidance on how to use them
- design patterns, which are reuseable approaches to a design need, ideally integrated within a adesign tool so that designers can quickly create mockups that follow the system

- component libraries of reusable elementsfor common cotrols or views, which cna be used to create anything from clickable rptotypes to features that are ready to test with little to no additional developlent needed.

- material design
- fluent
- carbon
- ADG

- human interface guidlines
- mailchimp


#### Accessibility

you should design your application with certain people in mind who may not beable to do something normal and is disabbled




## Essential Questions:

- Why is product definition important?

It can help to give structure to what we have leared so far

- What does Carolyn Chandler mean by defining ideas at "different levels"?

you can see the different levels of ideas from the big picture to the small and well defined

- What is the format of a user story?

As a **[user role]**
I want to **[action]**
so I can **[goal]**

- How are features and epics related to user stories?

the epic and the feaure help to give reason for the user story, user story would be considered lower level

- What does JTBD mean and why is it a useful frame?

Jobs to be done help to form a customer-centric frame work that focuses on the jobs that people need done rather than just products and their features.

- Describe two prioritization techniques

Kano Model plots on a graph with satisfaction and functionality
Opportuntiy scoring Importance + max(Importance - Satisfaction, 0) = Opportunity

- What are the questions you should ask during feature definition?

    - What is the product vision?
    - What probleme are we solving and why?
    - What technology considerations should we keep in mind?
    - What user insights should we keep in mind?
    - Whatproject considerations should we keep in mind
    - Are there any design or guiding principles for this effort?
    - What job stories should we include?
    - How are we going to measure success?
    - How we will determine whether the problem has been solved? What is our desired outcome?
    - What do we consider in scope of out of scope for this feature?
    - Are there any though starthers the team would like to share?

- What are the trade-offs between unity and variety?

if things are the same we are more able to place them together and if they are unique we can better distinguish them although if you are not able to either distinguish or tell that different symbols are together there is no good way of knowing what the symbols are for and what the associated symbols are.

- What is an association?

an association is the way that you connect different distinct ideas.

- What is an affordance?

the degree to wich the properties of the object make it clear how it can be used.

- what does skeuomorphism mean?

a design approach athat mimics the visual design of a three-dimensional physical object or space

- How is design related to psychology?

You have to understand how people think in order to make a design that makes sense to them.

- What is social proof and whydoes it matter?

social proof is just acceptance by other people like in comments or likes

- How does accessibility influence design?

You can design your product with the needs of specific people in mind that way they aren't left out.


## Reflection Questions:

- Explain how the product definition stage is a form of design convergence?

this is bringing a lot of different content and ideas and bringing them together as one.

- Create a doodle explaining the relationship between a user storu, feature, and epic

epic --> fearure --> user story

- Look at the app icons on your phone. Desccribe three of them in terms of unity and variety compared to the phon'es overall design

Phone app and the face time app and messages apps are green with a symbol in the middle a phone camera and text box respectivly. these are very symbol which helps us group them together as social or communication apps. but they are distinguished by their symbols.

- How can you improve your understanding of what's going on in other people's heads as a designer?

You can ask people, create personas, and brainstorm with others.
