# Chapter 1 The Tao of UXD

### What is a Tao? How does it relate to Ux Design

- A tao is a Chinese word that means way, path, road or principle
- This book will show us the path through Ux Design and Tao really refers to the underlying priciples

- We as humans have emotions and don't think in just black and white.
- this is why UX Design is both science and art

## What is User Experience Design

There are two definitions

- The broadest sense
- the definition of the book

#### The Broad Definition

*The creation and synchronization of the elements that affect user's experience with an organization's products and services, using data-informeed insights on user behavior and perception.*

- These things often reach beyond what a user can see tapping into other senses like touch, hearing, and even sometimes smell


#### Don't Forget the Tangible

- How ever when going through this course we have to remember that everything that we design doesn't happen in a vacuum.
- thats why this book fights to think both about the principles of UX Design and the practicality of the principles in real world applications.

#### Our Focus

- This subject is ever changing so this book will only be able to cover digital designs and only have to do with interactions with a human to a computer and only a computer

### About US Designers

- UX designing can be a lot of fun for people who don't think as black and white
- it has a good mix of being logical while also in and of itself being an art.
- It requires lots of understaning not of just computers but about people and thier problems
- Also in the real world we don't have infinite time and reasources so we need to be practical with our time and resources

### Where UX Designers Live

- There are a lot of places to look for other UX Designers and to continue to persue education and to stay up to date on everything.

### Lets get started!

# Chapter 2: The Project Ecosystem

- Understand the context of th the project before you even start!!

### Identify the Type of Product

- I dentifying the Prodect can help to understand what it is you are representing, and the audience

#### Brand Presence

- If you are making a digital brand presence the website could very well be the face of it all. It is very Important
- This would be shown to a very general audience it could be that the person searching for the company could be, a customer, a employee, a potential employee, and potential clients and investors

#### Promotional Product

- This is either targeted at a specific audience or a more general audience  but is used to promote something or elicit a responce from the audience in question
- This has to represent the product very well to show it's capability

#### Content Source

- Like social media this is not intended to lift up or sell anything other than the various types of media that are on the platform.
- Could be to inform, engage or entertain users

#### Task Based Application

- A tool used by a specific audience that would need it
- Very specific and helps to complete one to a few tasks well rather than engaging the user persay 

#### ECommerce Product

- Because ECommerce could be doing many of these things at once it is important to consider a specific audience and then simplify the process as much as possible

#### E-Learning Product

- this is tricky because people around the world learn on different platforms and so there needs to be a uniformity with all the different products
- also it is primarily focused on learning instead of the user trying to find some kind of information out the user is following the interface to aid in their understanding of the topic at hand.

#### Social Network

- Similar to content source but you are unable to completely control what is on the platform. Because people use it to connect it can be a completely different ball game with little to no data on users.

#### Consider Different Devices

- This is really important when designing an application there are so many different screen size possibilities. And testing applications on different platforms can help to midigate the issue of "It works on my machine"

#### Thinking Mobile
	- Mobile devices are more and more popular
	- When you are thinking mobile it forces you to get rid of the unnessasary fluff surrounding your application.
	- Additionally mobile devices are almost always equipt with gps and data which is important to think about when you switch between devices

#### Responsive Design

- This refers to designing the site to adapt depending on the screen size

#### Web Apps vs. Native Apps

- Native apps are typically better in many ways
- It is easier to monetize a product on mobile stores

- Web apps can reach further (theoretically)
- in most cases, a more cost-effective solution

#### Hybrid and Cross-Platform options

- There are some alternatives to these two approaches
- you can create some basic native funtionality and leave certain portions to be web app parts for ease of updating
- Also coding once and being able to deploy nativly on android and iphone is an option but it requires cross platform tools

#### Interactions Across Devices

- You have to think about how information can be scaled down to small watches or how it can be scaled for a computer

## Choose your hats

- though there are no official roles in ux we can define some here to make understanding both what you are good at and what things it is important for people to work on

#### Information Architect

- We must carefully craft how data is taken and given to the user in an efficient manner

#### Interation Designer

- This role helps to harness the different Interacitons of a website ensuring that everything does what it is supposed to and the user feels like there input is being heard

#### UI Designer

- the person in this role emphasizes on the look of the application and is responsible for ensuring the look and feel of the website is clear and consistent across pages.

#### Product Designer

- this person helps to develope the product further by experimenting with different kinds of interactions and choosing what should be in the final project.

#### User Researcher

- This role is responsible for knowing and understanding the user through research like interviews or even just previewing interactions on your application.

#### Other Roles You May Play

#### Brand Stratagist or steward

- this person really narrows in to the audience and picks out the key markets keeping in mind the brand and product.

#### Product Manager

- This role connects the world of designing a product to the business world

#### What are some of the most powerful ways that a UX designer and a product manager might complement eachother on a product team?

The UX Designer can help to bring creativity and push the product to look and feel the best for the end user and the product manager can ground the project into a reality of a budget and time constraint. also when there is a lot of elements to a ux design the product manager can help to simplify and streamline the whole deal which could potentially help improve the app more.


#### What are the most common complants each cole has about the other and how can we best over come them?

- Because each role has different interests in mind they have to understand that there is a nice balance between the roles that will make the best product in the end and that they are working ultimatly as a team

#### UX Stratagist

- this role defines the product and create with the end user and the business in mind

#### Service Designer

- This person gains a holistic view of the product space to help define what will be useful to the end user.

#### Business Analyst

- This is another link to the business world having connections to stakeholders and the tech world. they help to understand where the business as a whole would like the product to do.

#### Content Strategist

- This person helps realize all the various media the product will need

#### UX Writer

- This is similar to the author of a book these people help write the path through the product that the end user will go on. They ensure that everything makes sense all together.

#### Front-End Developer

- This is the developer of the front-end they help create the vision and bring it from an idea to a real life product

#### Taking on many roles

- taking on many roles can be necessary which makes it ever more important to understand the roles and see how they can fit together

#### Building a network of user advocacy

- Building your team, educating yourself, or building a support network inside the company can help to in the process.

## Understand the Company Culture

#### Company or Department Size

- in smaller companies you may need to take on more roles then if you work for a bigger company

#### Design Maturity

- This helps to position the company in such a way to help navigate to be their role in the economy as a whole.

#### Ops Teams

- Having multiple different teams in larger companies can help to push multiple objectives better and be more efficient.

#### In-House vs. Agency

- weather you are inhouse or you are developing from the outside can really change how the product is developed if you are in house then you will understand the company significantly better before developing anything for it where as an agency working with different clients can struggle to really get inside of a company and understand what they truely need/want.

#### Project History

If you have worked on things together in the past that can aid you in deciding scope and uncover vulerabilities in your group.

#### Hierarchy

- Having a strong structure can help form strong team work and can effect how well a group preforms

#### Pace, Place, and other logistics

- all the various logistics as well as communication help in the process of deciding how well everything will come together as a group.

## Pulling it Together

- Understanding your product and the different roles of your team can really impact how effective and efficient you can be together.

## Reflection Questions:

#### How would you describe the tone/feel of the book?

- It feels very down to earth and principled. Its tone conveys a sense of balence between knowing UX and using it in the real world. It sounds really different then many textbooks I've read. It is a lot more like the author is talking to me and relating to me!!

#### What other books that you've read would you say it is the most similar to in how you use it to get information?

- I would compare it to many non fiction books. I feel like it sounded like Clean Code. The author sounds like a real person and they are giving very practical and educational advice.

#### Is there a way you could improve the expoerince of using the book?

- I think having a physical copy would be nice but I don't think the cost would justify the improved experiance. I think continuing to take notes will help for refrencing later on.
