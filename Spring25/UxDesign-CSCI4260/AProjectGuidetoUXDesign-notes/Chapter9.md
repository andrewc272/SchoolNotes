# Chapter 9 UX Design Notes

## Chapter 9: Mapping Methods

Site map
: a visual way to display representative pages of a website or views within an application or product.

Process maps (often called task flows)
: Identify paths or processes that users (and sometimes a system) will take as they progress through your bebsite or application.

### Basic Elements of Mapping Methods

#### Page/Screen/View

- this is just the most basic element, what one page will look like

#### Pagestack

- represents multiple pages of similar content

#### Decisiton Point

- used to show the path that a user can take depending on the answer to a question.

#### Connectors and Arrows

- used to show movement or progress between pages

- a line on an arrow can indicate that the back arrow cannot be used

#### Conditions

- you can draw dashed arrows to represent that a connection is conditional

### Common Mistakes

- We want to make professional looking site maps for our portfolios so here are some of the mistakes people make when doing so so that we can avoid them.

#### Sloppy Connections

- One mistake is that connections aren't drawn well
- so always make sure any lines that touch any other object are connected with accuracy.

#### Misaligned and Unevely Spaced Objects

- No matter what make sure that everything is lined up and spaced out properly using things like grids can help you to make sure things are the correct distance apart.

#### Poorly Placed Text

- Although it may seem obvious placing text in a good spot will improve readability and can ensure the site map is professional

#### Lack of Page Numbering

- It is dificult to refer to different pages if you do not have page numbers to refrence. Because pages may have simmilar elements it is important to do so.

- Number every page of every site map that you create. Any page that you identify on your site map needs to be given a number  and your number ing system must allow for downstream changes that occur as new iterations and versions of your project are created.

- the numbering system can also transfer to other elements of design.

### Simple and COmplex Site Maps

- there are a few techniques that you can use when creatign a site map that is more complex that can help you make a more useful map. 
- start by puting the user in the landing page and create a process map all the way to the main page.
- having decision points separate from other pages can help identify keys within the process

#### Process Maps

- this is the flow of your website from page to page that demonstrates the different desicions and pages along the way
- A little clarity can go a long way

#### Journey Maps

- visualizations of a user's activity toward a specific goal as it is tied to a specific product or service

- Step 1 level set
    - Before: this phase is for all the planning and various considerations for the Super Bowl party that someone would od before they started to identify a list of caterers.
    - Browsign and deciding: This is when the user is performing their online searches and starting to estimate the costs, along with the pros and cons of the options available to them, so they can make the decision to order.
    - Ordering and fulfillment: when the user is ready to place and receive the order, they enter this phase fo their journey
    - After: this is the period of time after the catering ahs been received and the Super Bowl party has completed, which could include the teardon or any follow-ups needed.

- Step 2 brainstorming
    - Actions: Brain storm the various step s that users will take throughout each phase of the journey map. There can, and likely will, be multiple actions to explore
    - Thoughts/Feelings: Explore what the user is thinking about during each action and phase. This helps you understand what's on their mind as they go through their journey.
    - Obstacles: What are the various painnts of friction, or challenges, that the user encounters? What keeps the journey from moving forward smoothly during each phase?
    - Opportunities: Points of friction  can be opportunities. Explore how to use theise to differentiate the experience the user goes through.

- Step 3 Analysis
    - this is just about enhansing the user's experiance
    - we collect data and look for patterns and trends throughout the journey map to help the user
    - your finidngs and priorities are documented clearly and shared with your participants and stake holders

- Step 4 Crate the digital artifact
    - After all this analysis you can now dive in and create a detailed map

### Other Mapping Methods

- Emplathy maps and role empathy maps
    - these help create empathy fro users by categorizing observations and work-related behaviors
- Affinity maps
    - These are useful for clustering data or ideas into related groupings, frequently with sticky notes or their online digital equivalent, to help analyze qualitative information and to identify themes or patterns across large data sets.
- Service blueprints
    - These diagrams show the relationships between differetn actors and states across a product or service.
- Behavioral maps
    - These are based on structured ubservation and are useful for tracking movements and behaviors of users across specific activities, across time, or both. Behavioral mapping can be useful for improving the process/user flows or page/view layouts.

## Essential Questions

- Why is mapping critical for good UX design?

*It lays out the whole final product before it is made which can help prevent issues down the line. Also when changes are made later down the line it will be easier to readjust the original map and then continue on.*

- What is a process map?

*A process map identifies paths or processes that users (and sometimes a system) will take as they progress through your website or application.*

- Describe each of these components of a process map
    - Page/screen/view

*"The basic unit fo user experience on the web"*

    - Pagestack

*represents multiple pages of similar content

    - Decision Point

*is userd to show the path that a user can take depending on the answer to a question.*

    - Connectors and Arrows

*Used to show movement or progress between pages, pagestacks, decision points, and so on.*

    - Conditions

*Demonstrated as a dashed line that relies on some underlying condition.*

- Describe one common mistake when making a process map

Sloppy connections when lines are made between elements it is important to make sure that they clearly and uniquely identify 2 items.

- What is a journey map and how do you make one?

*A journey map is a visualization of a user's activity toward a specific goal as it is tied to a specific product or service. It is made by identifying key phases, thinking about thei different actions, thoughtsfeeligns, obstacles, and opportunites that the user goes through to get to the end goal. Then these ideas can be analized for patterns and then a detailed digital artifact can be made from it.*

## Reflection Questions

- How does a good map help you improve design?

*It ensures that everything is well thought through from start to finish which can improve the user's experiance and make the whole process faster and more efficient when designing an array of different tools.*

- How does a good map help a team implement a design?

*It makes sure that everyone is on the same team and that when there is changes to be made they can be easily implemented off of the backs of the previous map.*
