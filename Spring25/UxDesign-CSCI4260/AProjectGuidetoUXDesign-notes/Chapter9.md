## Chapter 9: Mapping Methods

Site map
: a visual way to display representative pages of a website or views within an application or product.

Process maps (often called task flows)
: Identify paths or processes that users (and sometimes a system) will take as they progress through your bebsite or application.

### Basic Elements of Mapping Methods

#### Page/Screen/View

- this is just the most basic element, what one page will look like

#### Pagestack

- represents multiple pages of similar content

#### Decisiton Point

- used to show the path that a user can take depending on the answer to a question.

#### Connectors and Arrows

- used to show movement or progress between pages

- a line on an arrow can indicate that the back arrow cannot be used

#### Conditions

- you can draw dashed arrows to represent that a connection is conditional

### Common Mistakes

#### Sloppy Connections

#### Misaligned and Unevely Spaced Objects

#### Poorly Placed Text

#### Lack of Page Numbering

### Simple and COmplex Site Maps

#### Process Maps

#### Journey Maps

### Other Mapping Methods
