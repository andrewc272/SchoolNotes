## Chapter 5 Discovery

#### Discovery phases

- Project Kick off

- Prototyping
- Analysis and modeling
- Presenting your findings

#### Kickoff, Preparationm and Pre-Planning for Discovery

- find stakeholders
- create an interview guide
    - History of related work
    - Current competitors on the market
    - Blockers
    - Customer insights
    - stakeholder prioritis
    - what is success?
- conduct an interview w. stakeholders
- find any other kinds of research you can find
- analyze and synthesize stakeholder interview notes

#### Kickoff workshop

- create a workshop plan
    - who needs to be ther when and for how long
- make an agenda
    - introductions
    - Usergroups review and validation
    - stakeholder interviews review
    - high-level stakeholder requirements
    - Stakeholder requirements prioritization

#### Detailed Discovery Planning

- the goal of this step is to create a detailed report back to customers and stakeholders for a solution

- during the discovery effort there are a few roles that should be filled 
    - Technical architect
    - Solution architect
    - Product manager
    - Additional UX designers or product designers
    - Data engineer or data scientist

- define project assumptions
    - What should the final product provide to the end users?
    - What does the solution add to or remove from the user's experience to make it a more effective and efficient?
    - How does the oranization benefit from the final product?
    - What would make the solution be considered reliable or trusted by end users?
    - How would the solution reduce the user's burden and make it easier for them to accomplish their goals?
    - What is considered the biggest risk to the solution being a success for the organization or for end users?
    - How can the team mitigate those risks early on and avoid them lter on in development?

- Develope a project brief
    - Primary objective
    - Target users
    - Define project success

- Develope user researc plan
    - project overview
    - Research goals and assumptions
    - target user profiles
    - recruitment mthod and screener
    - Research logistics
    - research method scripts and guides
    - target research outputs
- Delivering the project breiief and research plan
    - reassure customers and stakeholders that their problem will be solved
- facilitate user research plan

#### Prototyping

- explore different concepts and designs
- review different designs and come up with a few to try
- test each for useability
- prepare a prototype presentation for stakeholders

#### Research Analysis and Findings

- choose an analysis method
    - Affinity mapping
    - Quadrand analysis
    - Spectrum analysis
- create a report
    - exectuive summary
    - themes and recommendations
    - next steps
    - appendices

#### Presenting Your findings

- show off to stake holders

#### Discover Your Own Way

###### Success comes in different forms
- Completing the discovery effort itself is success
- The hypothesis was validated as correct
- the hypothesis was determined to be needing a pivot or refinement
- the hypotheses was determined to be incorrect, or possibly the wrong hypothesis.

## Chapter 6: Whorkshops and Collaboration Activities

#### Preperation

- it isn't just about scheduling a meeting it is cultivating an environment where people feel comfortable colaborating
- find the right people
- find the right anount of people
- find different roles that need to be filled

    - Clarify and highlight the purpose and outcomes of the workshop or collaboration activities
    - share the agenda and timing
    - define the roles and responsibilities for your participants
    - establish rules of engagement
    - explain the technology and tools being tilized
    - encourage questions and address concerns

#### Sample Activities

    - How difficult is this requirement, feature, goal, or request to design, develop, or create?
    - How impactful will this requirement, feature, goal, or request be on our team, customer, user, or product?
    - plan for prioritization
        - What upcomming needs or requests are going to be asked of the team to deliver and implement?
        - What happened recetly with a deployment that caused issues with the team or the users?
        - What are the top five issues that are brought up doing customer service requests?
        - What are some key blockers or challenges that the team experiences when trying to seccessful deploy a new feature or enhancement?
    - Brainstorm material
    - Evalueate and clarify
    - Dot voting
    - an affinity diagram is a great way to collect ideas from different groups
    - use a role empathy map
    - Identify the role
    - Brainstorm
        - goals 
        - key tasks
        - Works well
        - Pain Points
        - Work arounds
        - distractions
    - refinement
    - sketch and critique
    - preperations
    - individual sketchinng
    - paired critique
    - group sketching and refinement
    - group presentation an critique
    - Final revisions
    - Usability teting
        - Invite participation
        - Explain what's involved
        - Introduce the design
        - Presnt your tasks
        - wrap it up
    - Lessons learned
    - diversity helps with aproaching a problem

#### Follow up actions

- Assign follow-up actions
- Schedule follow-up meetings or discssion
- Share and discuss next steps
- Write workshop summary or report
- Gather feedback

#### This I s a Lot of Work, and It's a Lot of Fun!

- just take it as a learning experiance just relax and have fun!

## Essential Questions:

#### What does diesocery mean in the context of UX design?

- discovery in ux design means flushing out a problem and finding a solution based on research and testing.

#### What are the 9 stages of the example process flow they give you in chapter 5?

- Project Kick off
- Preparation and pre-planning
- stakeholder interviews
- Kickoff workshop
- Detailed discovery planning
- Research and investication
- Prototyping
- Analysis and modeling
- Presenting your findings

#### What is the purpose of a kickoff?

- a kickoff introduces a problem and briefs everyone on a plan and intention to fix the goal

#### Why is discovery planning important?

- It helps to guide the rest of the project and can prevent bigger "obvious" blockers that may be difficult or expensive to work around

#### How is prototyping related to research and analysis?

- This helps a designer to figure out just what works and see how they want the final product to look and feel.

#### What are three of the nethods from chaper six and what do they look like?

- Role empathy map
- prioritization activity
- sketch and critique

## Reflection Questions:

#### If you had to make a discovery plan for a group project, how would you go about that?

- I would follow the steps given above. I would identify who all is involved figure out a problem and come together to find a solution.

#### What resources could you use to help you with discovery?

- Interviewing is really helpful because it can help you gain insights you may not have otherwise.

#### Which activities from chapter 6 seemed the most fun to you?

- I think the drawing one seems like the most fun. I think it would be interesting what people express through what they draw I feel like it makes it all more meaning full to the drawer in a way that not many other methods can.

#### If you had to perform a collaboration activity to design a better book, which one would you use and why?

- An affinity diagram would be a good one to use because you can get a lot of different little insights on what improvements could be made.
