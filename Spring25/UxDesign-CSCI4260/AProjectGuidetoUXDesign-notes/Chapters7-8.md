# Chapters 7&8 UX Design

## Chapter 7: User Research

#### Basic Steps of User Research

- Define your primary user groups
- Plan your research 
- conduct the research
- form and shar your findings
- validate your usr group definitions
- Generate yser-focused product ideas

##### Define Your User Groups

- Create a list of attributes 
- Discuss and expand on the attributes
- prioritize the attributes that have the most impact
- segment the user groups

##### Create a List of Attributes

- Documetns that stratigec considerations
- Data-based segmentations of current customers and other demographic data
- Previously conducted user research
- Surveys
- customerservice reports

###### User attributes

- Promary user goals
- Roles
- Demographics
- Experience
- Work attributes

##### Prioritize and Define

- Current frequency of trading
- number of product types traded
- level of subject-matter expertise
- level of techical savvy

#### Plan Your Research

- How do nonprofessionals learn how to trade stock in the first place?
- What digital products do they use? Do they user a computer, a mobile device , or some combo to research and trade?
- When do they tend to trade stock?
- What kind of research do they do on a stockbefore they purchase?
- What kind of research do they do on a stock before they purchase?
What are theiripressions of trading options? Are they worried that trading options would be too risky?
- How many nonprofessional stock traders also trade options, currently?

<br>

- Understand the common trading tools and habits of nonprofessional stock traders
- uncover the obstacles that may stop a stock treader from learnign how to trade options
- determine the percentage of nonprofessional stock traders who have also traded options

##### Qualitative Research vs. Quantitative Research

- Quantitative rsearch is focused on numerical data and is meant to provide *high-confidence, repeadable results* among your target user groups

- Qualitative research focuses on gaining *context* and *insight* regarding user behavior.

##### Product Analytics

- if you have a product out there you can use analitics to determine how people use your product

##### Event Tracking and Funnels

- this is tracking actions a user takes on your product like liking a post and selecting an article

**For improving a search feature**

- Which search filters get used the most often?
- How frequently do users use the Advanced search?
- How often does a visitor select one of their results after seraching? Does this number vary between those using the basic search versus the Advanced serach?

<br>

- Of all visitors whoperformed a search in the past 30 days, how many opened the Advanced search at some point (whether or not they used it)?
- Of all visitiors who performed a search in the bast seven days, how many actually used the Advanced search?

##### Choose Your Research Method(s)

- USer interviews
- Field studies
- F0cus Groups
- Card sorting
- Surveys
- Product Analytics
- Usability Testing
- A/B Testing (for live sites)

##### How Many Research Activities Can I Include

- you must figure out your timeline so you can know what and how many Acitvities you can do?

- Budget and timeline
- where your highest areas of risk are, if you were to act without user insights
- Why you're conducting the research: what you want to learn from it
- Who you're including: the primary user groups you outlined above
- How you'll get participantsL recruting people to participate and screenting them
- How you'll compensate participants
- What space, equipment, and software you'll nee, based on whether you'll be in person our you will conduct researhc remotely
- What you're covering" the primary topics
- How you're capturing information: the number of people involved and the tools they're using

#### Conduct the Research

##### User Interviews

- Structured conversations with current or potential ueres of your site

#### The Basic Process

Interview topics

- relevent experiance with the project
- the company's brand
- Attitudes toward
- common goals or needs
- pain points in the overall process
- other people hwo are involved in the experiance
- any other information that will help you validate assumptions you've made

##### Interviewign Tips

- never ask leading questions don't guide the person to the answer
- record the interview to look back on

##### Contextual Inquiry

> combines field observation with interviewign techniques

- the real-life problems ysers are facing
- the kind of equpment they're working with
- the space they're working within
- their prefrance in interacting by mouse, keyboad, or touch
- How they're working with others

##### The Basic Process

- 10 min introduction
- start with high level questions
- active observaiton is where the participant will walk you through this product while you take the role of the trainee to see what they see
- passive observation is where the participant will interact with the application as if you are not even there. this will show closer to how someone would use your product if they are alone.

##### Focus Groups

> involve brigning together a variety of people with in a target audience and facilitating a discusstion with them.

- Hearing a variety of user stories
- Understandign relevat differences in experiences.
- Generating ideas
- understanding multiple points of a collaborative process

##### The Basic Process

- explain your role as moderator
- why the attendees were chosen
- how the information will be used
- let them know they are okay to share whatever
- there are many topics to cover so they may have to move on even if a discussion isn't complete

- get everyone to talk on the first question that way everyone feels involved
- if you need to call on someone make sure to repeat the question so they don't need to ask
- control the flow by asking questions and leading the discussion in a natural way
- Indicate when there is a new topic so people don't get confused

##### Card Sorting

> participants are given itemps printed on cards and are asked to put them into groups that make sense to them. either in to premade groups or groups that they decide on

##### The Basic Process

- collect different ideas you would like to catagorize
- choose items that are easy to understand without too much jargoon

Give the following instructions

- Arrange these cards in whatever groups make sense to you
- try to have at least two cards ina group. If a card seems to belong to not group, you can place it to the side.
- At any tie as you're sorting, you can name a gorup, By the end of the activity please name asmany groups as you can.

##### Variations on the Card Sort

- Closed sorts the highlevel categories are provided and participants add to them
- group sorts this is where a collective group will come up with groupings for items

##### Surveys

> involve a set colleciton of well-defined questions distributed to a large audience

- can help see somewhat qualitative information in a more quantitative way

##### The Basic Process

- create a survey based on the information that you want to figure out
- yes/no, strongly agree - strongly disagree, multiple box slection

##### Survey Tips

- who are you targeting
- What method for distributing the survey will give you the best results
- How much time will participants be willing to spend filling out the survey
- How will you know when to start analyzing the data
- What tool will you use to collect and analyze the data

##### Usability Testing

> involves asking participants to perform specific tests on a site or application fo find usability issues and gather ideas to address them

##### A/B Testing

> is a method of comparing two designs to see which performs better agains a particular measure

##### Forma dn Share Findings

- there maybe a lot of information to churn though so it is important to figure out how to compile and share the findings

##### A Quick Guide to Affinity Diagramming

- Code your participants with anumber and color, giving each a unique sticky note color.
- Break ot hte research notes for each participant onto separate stickies using their colors.
- Doa round of cleanup to make sure you have one data point per sticky note
- Gather the team, make it collaborative
- Ask people to cluster together statements together
- once clusters tart to form the tea should start labeling the clusters to provide further structure.

<br>

- Goals
- Mental models
- ideas and feature requests
- frustrations
- workarounds
- value statements


##### Sharing Your Findings

- Make sure to make it nice an consice with the option to explore more that way more people are likely to read the information and the money the stakeholders used is not wasted/

Ask questions like

- what you set out to learn
- what you dd learn
- the key insights
- your recommendation after the research

#### After the Research

- the next steps are to look back at your originall assumptions and reassess to get a better idea of who will use the product and how.
