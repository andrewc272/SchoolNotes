# Chapter 12 and 13 Notes

## Chapter 12 Content Strategy

- Content startegy is about the planning for all that content that stakeholders and clients like to leave until the very last minute.

### Why Do You Need Content?

- "Conetent shared across networks is likely to be the first experience a user or customer has with your brand, while the content within a website or application drives loyalty once brand interaction has been accomplished."

### When Do You Need Content Strategy?

- The content strategy should be started way from the very begining.

### Who Does Content Strategy?

- anyone on a team can do content starategy but there needs to be at least 1 person doing it so if no one else is doing it you are up to bat!!

### How Long Does Content Strategy Last?

- Forever, because the content is the face of the brand the content that you produce should be able to last forever and still represent the company well.

### This Sounds Familiar...

- this idea ties into a lot of other ideas in us design like agile and diffreent strategies that we have learned about. These methods can also be used in the creation of a content strategy.
- content strategy is not information architecture
- Content strategy is not copywriting
- Content strategy is also not content marketing

### Tools of the Trade

- the following are different artifacts that may be useful

#### The Artifacts

- these are also called the deliverables or client/project/product documentation, but whatever their name, they are the tools  of the content strategy trade that help herd the content cats.

#### Quantitative Audit

- or a content audit or page inventory, a quantitative audit is a fairly basic audit that is easy enough to complete using any spreadsheet tool

#### Qualitative Audit

- also a content audit, a page inventory, or a content assessment a qualitative audit is a much more thorough examination of the content.

#### Message Architecture

- Is one of the first ctivities you should engage in.
- Categorizing adjectives to desctibe their brand or product
- filtering the adjectives while focusing on how the brand or product should be perceived through the work fo the project
- Prioritizing the goals by focusing only on the "We;d like to be" column

#### Content Matrix

- is pretty similar to-if not an extension of- the quantitative audit

##### Content Governance Plan

- serves as the back bone of content strategy by establishing a framework for standards, guidelines, and processes that quide the lifecycle of content.

##### Editorial Calendar

- your project plan for upcoming content and serves as a central hub for coordinating publications across multiple channels, commonly managing blog posts, social media updates, and newsletters.
- What to publish based on audience needs and your brainstormed ideas
- Priorities for items you plan to pyblish
- work effort required to publish each piece of content
- Micro- content needed (for example, page titles, headlines, navigation link labels, ALT tags, footers, blurbs)
- Dates assigned for writing, editing, publishing for each piece of content
- Publishing location (for example, pritn, blog, email newsletter, X, the platform formenly known as Twitter, Facebook)

- Who owns what content?
- How much content will be largely static?
- How much will need to be revisited with some regularity and/or scheduled?
- When will content be retired?

##### Content Flow

- or editorial workflow, content flow is a diagram that shows how content is created and moves through editorial and approval channels, then goes live.

##### Real-Time Content Collaboration Tools

- these are tools that are useful because you can share your Ux Designs quickly.

##### What Is the One Artifact You Need?

- If you are new to content startegy, your safest bet is to start with one of the content audit documents so you can get your feet wet while learning a log about the content that you are, or will be, working with.

### Things to Look Out For

- Deleting content is good
- COntent can be incredibly political and messy
- Who is paying for the content startegy?
- Time and resources management for ongoing content startegy can be a challenge.
- Content strategy as an afterthought.

## Chapter 13 Wireframes And Prototypes

Prototyping
: is the act of (and in many cases, the art of) creating, mimichin or testing all or part of the functionality of a product or application with users.

Wireframes
: Low-fidelity (no- or low-code) examples of screens or products , to identify the elements that will desplayed on a screen, such as:

- Navigation
- content sections
- Imagery, media, or both
- Form elements
- calls to action(CTAs) and interactive elements

### Who Are Your Wireframes and Prototypes For?

|Audience|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Project & Product Management|Project and product managers may use wireframes and prototypes as discussion points  within the team and to stakeholdrs to highlight strategy, technology needs, and very high-level user experience.|
|Business Analysts|Business analysts may use wireframes to ensure that their requirements are being met ad to validate that they have not missed requirements that need to be included.|
|Visual/UI Designers|Visual/UI designers may use wireframes and prototypes as a blueprint for their output. Wireframes and prototypes provide them witha n accounting of page elements and behaviors that need to be included.|
|Content Creators|Copywriters, content strategists, IX writers, editors, and others responsible for copy may use wireframes and prototypes to map to a content matrix and identify content needs throughout a project.|
|Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Specialists|SEO specialists canuse wireframes and prototypes to help identify appropriate naming schemes, copy needs, and enhancements to the overall SEO strategy. (For more information on SEO, see "User Experience Design and Search Engine Optimization," available on the companion website.)|
|Developers|Developers often use wireframes and prototypes in conjunction with user stories and businesss require ments to understand the expected functions and behaviors of the design. In some cases, the wireframes and prototypes may be used as the basis for a proof of concept.|
|Quality Assurance| A QA team can use wireframes and prototypes as the basis for authoring testing scripts and validating against acceptance criteria|
|Users|Users may see wireframes and prototypes in very early stages, sometimes in the form of "paper prototypes" as a mechaninsm to test the design direction and proposed functionality. This is useful for early validation of hypotheses|
|Stakeholders, Customers, Product Owners|Customers and prduct owners may be actively involved in the review of wireframes and prototypes to validate whether the business requirements, goals, and objectives are met.|

#### Collaborative Creation

- Collaboration creates the best of wireframes

### Getting Started Creating Wireframes

- information
- Epics and suer stories
- Business requirements
- Design briefes, or creative briefs, or other named briefs that are relevant
- Stakeholder interviews
- User research
- Product analytics
- Personas that are rich with information about your users, and/or detailed information about the roles you're designing for and their needs
- site map
- user/task flows or paths
- content strategy documentation
- statement of work

#### Sketch First

- dont be afraid of pencil and paper!!

#### Design, Don't Draw

- we are more worried about the ideas here not necesarily how pretty it looks
- a fundamental tool that designers express, develop and communicate design ideas
- a critical part of a process that begins with idea generation, to design elaboration to design choices and ultimately to engeneering

### Happy Dog: A Wireframe Design Example

#### Gather Your Information

- This is the start you need to have enough information to be confident in being able to create a design

#### Think, Then Sketch

- Churn through all the information and think about what the needs of different people are with the tool you want to create.
- Then sketch, remember you aren't painting the mona lisa here

#### Into the Digital

- Make it into something useable or just something that you will eventually interact with in a similar way

#### Season with Documentation

- Good designers document everything

#### Wire frames to User Interface

help bring the user interface to life

### How Much rototyping Do I Need?

- It depends on the situation

#### Paper Prototyping

- This is the easiest and fastest but it tends to not be as useful when getting feed back becuase it is so far from the end product

#### Digital Prototyping

- this is harder but it is closer to the end product which is helpful when getting feedback.
- What types of resources, tools, and skills do you have available?
- Who are you building this prototype for and why?
- What does your timeline look like?

#### Which Design Is Right?

- There is no right or wrong answer as long as the requirement are met and users can accomplush their tasks effeciently and effectively.

### What Happens After Prototyping?

- Find strong metaphors to convey the diffreences between your wireframes and the final design of the project.

## Essential Questions:

- Why does the book say you need content strategy?

*There are a lot of cases where people say to worry about content later but there needs to be a plan in place right now alongside the design.*

- How can understanding content strategy make you better at UX design?

*Because you can't have one without the other. They go hand in hand so If you want to be a good UX designer you need to also be a good content strategist.*

- What is a wireframe and when should you make one?

- You should make one after you have already collected infromation and landed on a design

- Who are wireframes for?

*they are just very simple ways of demonstrating a design digitally typically*

- What does the process of making a wireframe look like?

You make a paper design and then you make a digital one getting closer to the final product as you go.

- When is a paper prototype useful?

When you want to quickly mock something up

- When is a digital prototype useful?

When you want to get decent feedback in a more realistic setting.

## Reflection Questions

- Do you agree with the authors' assertion that content strategy is critical to the success of an application? Why or why not?

I think there is validity to it but I don't think it should be as intense as the author seems to elude to. I think that with a vast majority of applications there is so little "content" that needs to be produced that as long as you are aware of the content you will need to make you should be good.

- Give an example of a content-focused application and a non-content-focused application you use; which one is mpre useful to you personally?

Youtube would be content focused and I guess messaging is less content focused. I think that content focused aplications are very useful to me because it is where I get information and where ideas can be exchanged.

- When should you choose a paper prototype of a digital prototype?

When you want a quick mock up for ideas and want to get just an easy baseline down.
