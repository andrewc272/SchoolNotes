### Major Topics
1. Words
1. Syntax
1. Meaning
1. Discourse
1. ^Applicaitons exploiting each^

- What makes an application a language processing applicaiton?
    - an application that requires the use of knowlage about human languages
- word count?
    - when it counts yes
        - you need to define what a word is. that's the knowledge of language
    - when it doesn't count
        - just counting the clusters of letters without knowing if they are words
- Speech recognition, and synthesis
- knowledge of english words
- how groups of words clump
- Dialog
    - It is polite to respond, even if you're planning to kill someone.
    - it is polite to preted to want to be cooperative
- NLP has an Ai aspect to it or is an AI task itself
- We'll be intermingling discussions of 
    - Linguistic topics
    - Applications
- Computational inguists are obsessed with ambiguity
- we have to resolve ambiguity
- I made her duck
    - She crouched down because of my action
    - She was turned into a duck because of an aciton I preformed
    - I cooked duck for her
    - Her duck was made by me
    - This sentence is very ambiguous
    - there can be meanings from previous states of language and new meanings from the future of language.
- priavacy alternatives to ChatGPT
- Lexical category duck can be a noun or a verb
- her can be possessive  of her or dative for her
- made transitive, ditransitive, Action-transitive
- Phonetics!
    - I mate or duck
    - I'm eight or duck
    - Eye maid; her duck
    - Aye mate, her duck
    - I maid her duck
### Four possible approaches

- Tightly couple interaciton among processing levels; knowledge from other levels can help decide among chices at ambiguous levels.
- Pipeline processing that ignores ambiguity as it occurs and hopes that other levels can eliminate incorrect structures.
- Porbabilistic approaches based on making the most likely choices
- Don't do anything, maybe it won't matter
- We will get a taste of ambiguity and complexities that it brings to the table of NLP
- We will study computational approaches to a variety of small and medium tasks in NLP by means of [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/index.html)

### Chapter 1

- What can we acheive by combining simple programming techniques with large quantities of text?
- How can we automatcially extract key words and phrases that sum up the style and context of a text?
- What tools and techiniques does they python programming language provide for such work?
